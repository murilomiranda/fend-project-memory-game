Memory Game can be played when the page is completely loaded. Each turn, one player can click on two cards. If they have the same symbol, then gets a match. Otherwise, these two cards flip face down.
When all cards are matched, then a modal box pops up congratulating and shows how many moves and time were necessary to finish the game. It also shows how many stars were obtained.

## Counting STARS
Each game starts with three stars. According to the number of moves, the number of stars decreases:
3. between 8 and 12 moves;
2. between 13 and 18 moves;
1. between 19 and 26 moves; and
0. above 26 moves

## Comparing scores
Playing two games or more, a table with older scores will appear in "congratulations" modal box.

| Try | Moves | Time | Stars |
|:---:| :---: |:---: | :---: |
|  0  |   24  |00:56 |   1   |
|  1  |   18  |01:22 |   2   |

If reset button is clicked, this table will be deleted.
